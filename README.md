Profile Project:

Description:

This project was a simple one. This is the very most first project I ever created API project. The API I used here was called JSON Place Holder. A site where you can find some dummy information to use and display. So I decided to make a list of profiles just to get used to using API's to the screen. 

So i basically just call and get ten users information and display it to the webpage in a creative way. The information I am getting is username, email, phone and address. So just picture if you go onto a site and want to know certain information about a user and then you will then be able to see it.
